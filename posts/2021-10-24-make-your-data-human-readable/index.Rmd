This is a slidy presentation made by RMarkdown. It probably won't look good on your phone.

This is the main argument of the talk
=========
**Sharing your data**

* Machine-readable is necessary, but not sufficient for real world use
* Complex data also needs to be human-readable
* Write instructions to go along with your data


It started with a dataset
=======
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

options("xtable.comment" = F,
        "xtable.include.rownames" = F,
        "xtable.size" = "tiny",
        "width" = 160)

options("kableExtra.html.bsTable" = T)

suppressPackageStartupMessages(require(tidyverse))
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
include_graphics("img/NBBM_nina.png" )
```

"Darwin Core Event" made it possible to publish the full dataset on GBIF
=========
```{r, out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics("img/NBBM_gbif_smaller.png" )
```

The European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme wanted it for a meta-analysis
======

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
include_graphics("img/eBMS.png" )
```

A detour about formats
==========
* Sadly, data often start off like this. Not machine-readable.

```{r, out.width = '90%'}
include_graphics("img/not_machine_readable.png" )
```



```{r}
lok_data <- tibble(location = c("lok_1", "lok_2", "lok_3", "lok_4"),
                   habitat = rep(c("forest", "grassland"), 2),
                   region = c("region_1", "region_1", "region_2", "region_2"),
                   country = rep("Norway", 4))

meas_data <- expand.grid(location = c("lok_1", "lok_2", "lok_3"),
                         sample_round = c("sample_1", "sample_2", "sample_3")
                         ) %>% 
  mutate(sample_id = row_number(),
         sample_time = rep(c("2020-05-01", "2020-05-10", "2020-06-10"), each = 3))

variable_data <- tibble(sample_round = c("sample_1", "sample_2", "sample_3"),
                        covariate_1 = NA,
                        covariate_2 = NA,
                        measurement_to_explain = NA)


long_data <- meas_data %>% 
  left_join(variable_data,
            by = c("sample_round" = "sample_round")) %>% 
  left_join(lok_data,
            by = c("location" = "location")) %>% 
  select( country,
         region,
         location,
         habitat,
         sample_round,
         sample_time,
         sample_id,
         everything()) %>% 
  arrange(region,
          location,
          sample_round
          ) %>% 
  mutate(covariate_1 = runif(nrow(.), min = 0, max = 1),
         covariate_2 = runif(nrow(.), min = 5, max = 10),
         measurement_to_explain = runif(nrow(.), min = 0, max = 100)) %>% 
  as_tibble()

var_data_to_print <- long_data %>% 
  select(sample_id,
         covariate_1,
         covariate_2,
         measurement_to_explain)


```

A detour about formats
========
* When it's ready for analysis, the data is usually in "long format" (each time point per subject has its own row) 
* Complex data often end up with many columns and redundant data 
  - This takes more space, and require custom quality checks

```{r}
long_data %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

A detour about formats
==========
* But data is often stored in a "normalized" way, in separate tables that represent the sampling hierarchy

```{r}
cat("Note that this could be split up further")
lok_data
```

```{r}
meas_data %>% 
  select(sample_id,
         everything())
var_data_to_print
```

A detour about formats
=========
* GBIF data is machine readable 
* But to fit many types of data into one format,
  - some columns in the original data have to be combined
  - separate event tables have to be stacked
  - sample hierarchy is stored as parent and child events (child events can also have children...)


A detour about formats
========
* GBIF Event Core data can look like this

```{r, echo = F, results ='hide', warning = F, message = FALSE}
event_small <- read_delim("rawData/event_small.txt",
                          delim = "\t")

event <- read_delim("rawData/event.txt",
                          delim = "\t",
                    guess_max = 10000)
```

```{r event_table, echo = F}
event %>% 
    filter(eventID == 'fffcc609-fbba-42c1-b264-0912d9d7b2af' |
           parentEventID == 'fffcc609-fbba-42c1-b264-0912d9d7b2af')  %>% 
  head(5) 
```

```{r event_table_2, echo = F, eval = F}
event %>% 
  select(eventID,
         parentEventID,
         dynamicProperties
         ) %>% 
  filter(eventID == 'fffcc609-fbba-42c1-b264-0912d9d7b2af' |
           parentEventID == 'fffcc609-fbba-42c1-b264-0912d9d7b2af') %>% 
  select(dynamicProperties) %>% 
  head(5) 
```

```{r, echo = F, results = 'hide', warning = F, message = FALSE}
occurrence_small <- read_delim("rawData/occurrence_small.txt",
                          delim = "\t") %>% 
  mutate(individualCount = as.integer(individualCount))

```

```{r occurrence_table, echo = F}
occurrence_small %>%  
  head(5) 
```

A detour about formats
========
* This is machine-readable
* But if a human doesn't understand it, who will tell the machine how to read it?


So, I made a recipe to go from the GBIF event core to a usable format
=============

```{r, out.width = '50%'}
include_graphics("img/recipe_gbif.png" )
```

Now anyone using R can quickly make use of the data
=======
```{r child = 'child_pages/NBBM_GBIF_to_BMS_export.md'}
```
  

How do you do this?
===========
* Simply write a script in RMarkdown that does the job
* Publish it 
  - On Github. 
  - Or on a blog (with a stable URL)
* Link to it in the GBIF metdata

Publishing on Github
===============
* You could put a simple .md file in a repository
* Or make it fancy with Github pages. http://pages.github.com 
* You can even set up your own blog with `library(blogdown)`
  - See e.g. https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html
* There are many templates to use for Github pages. You can even get a custom URL.

Sounds like a lot of work?
============
* Have you ever regretted writing a clear and readable R-script?
* Get in the habit of clearly annotating your R-code!
  - You mostly collaborate with yourself, and you-from-two-months-ago don't respond to email (common Software Carpentry saying)
* Some writing principles  
  - Don't underestimate your reader's intelligence, but don't overestimate their knowledge
  - Keep it succinct
  - But explain all the steps
